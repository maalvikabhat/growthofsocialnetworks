### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

I think the team did a good job of outlining their project in the abstract. I understand that they are answering the question, "What are the effects of grid shape on the Turing Patterns that emerge in Cellular Automata models?" 
It seems like they are honing in on a model that passes "tokens" between spaces on a hexagonal grid. 

### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

The team seems to first be implementing a variation on the model using a square grid, where tokens spread to the neighboring eight cells rather than six. To extend the experiment, I am understanding that they will also try a third approach, in which tokens are spread to the neighboring four cells directly adjacent.
I think this makes sense in the context of the paper and the question they began with. 

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

I understand what the results are supposed to show because of how they outlined that they could show a row of a variety of tunings for the shared parameters between the models, as I think that could be a really helpful visualization. 
I think the figures could do with captions/labels instead of just one sentence explaining them in the Results section.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

The interpretation of potential results definitely holds water and makes sense to me. 
I appreciate that they discussed the additional parameters, and I hope they can provide examples of the new model as columns below the rows. I agree with them that this would create a visually interpretable breakdown of the differences between the models.

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

The team articulates that they have a diffusion-reaction model implementation of a hexagonal grid and a rectangular grid, and those the results with the models vary quite a bit. 
But they also say they are still in the process of implementing the token function that is described in the paper


### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

Yes! The team seems to first be implementing a variation on the model using a square grid, where tokens spread to the neighboring eight cells rather than six. To extend the experiment, I am understanding that they will also try a third approach, in which tokens are spread to the neighboring four cells directly adjacent.


### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

Yes, the team seems to be making great progress in understanding the paper, their problem statement, and making strides to make the final project a reality.

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guideLinks to an external site.?

I think the report was easy to read and understand, clear and concise. As the target audience, I felt like it was written appropriately. They use the word "interesting," though, which should be an easy fix.

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

Yes. The only thing I might do differently is move the Annotated Bibliography to the end of the report.
