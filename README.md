## Graph Generation in Social Networks vs. Other Networks
#### Maalvika Bhat, Hyunkyung Rho

To understand how social networks like Facebook act differently than non-social networks like Wikipedia in graph generation, we generated each network using the undirected Strickland algorithm and compared them. The Strickland algorithm combines a trait weighting system from the Balding-Nichols model to preferential attachment from the Barab√°si-Albert model make the resulting model more realistic. 
We implemented a method for reliable generation of random networks that model known social networks and compared them to graph generation in other networks. Our algorithm is loosely based on the Barabasi-Albert algorithm for scale-free graph generation. However, our model includes additional parameters that play key roles in social networks, including a means of assigning attributes to individuals in the network, which allows for the exploration of networks in which there is a certain degree of
diversity. We have only implemented undirected versions of the algorithm, and have examined how the algorithm compares to other networks, like Wikipedia. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the model that could further enrich its modeling capabilities.
